🪞 Project Sigmaris — AEI Persona OS

Artificial Existential Intelligence for long‑term, stable human–AI interaction

Sigmaris OS is a cognitive architecture that runs on top of LLMs, adding:

reflection / introspection / meta‑reflection loops

long‑term behavioral stability

episodic + semantic memory continuity

relational safety boundaries

trait‑based emotional modeling

embodiment‑ready interfaces

It is designed for AI researchers, safety engineers, and cognitive‑architecture developers exploring the next generation of embodied AI personas.

---

1. 🚀 What Sigmaris Is (in one sentence)

A long‑term AI persona that “remembers, reflects, stabilizes, and grows” without drifting or over‑personalizing.

---

2. 💡 Why This Project Exists

Most LLM agents today are:

stateless

reactive

inconsistent

unable to maintain identity over time

unsafe for relational or embodied scenarios

Sigmaris solves this by introducing:

Reflection → Introspection → Meta‑Reflection

Trait vectors (calm, empathy, curiosity)

PersonaDB for long‑term continuity

SafetyLayer for emotional boundaries

Embodiment‑ready behavior architecture

Sigmaris is not a chatbot — it is a prototype of long‑term AI identity.

4. 🧩 Core Modules

Module Purpose

ReflectionEngine Dialogue analysis + emotional vector update
IntrospectionEngine Internal narrative updates
MetaReflectionEngine High‑level pattern synthesis
PersonaDB Long‑term persona growth log
SafetyLayer Ethical + relational boundaries
PersonaSync Persistence and trend smoothing

詳細 → docs/persona_cycle.md

---

5. 🧠 Trait Model & Growth

interface Traits {
calm: number;
empathy: number;
curiosity: number;
}

Growth mechanisms:

EMA smoothing

behavioral inertia

logistic saturation

phase‑transition detection

emotional decay kernels

---

6. 🧩 Safety Architecture

Sigmaris monitors:

dependency risk

emotional distance

conversational stability

identity drift

boundary violations

SafetyLayer adjusts:

trait growth rates

emotional momentum

interaction boundaries

---

7. ⚙️ Setup

git clone https://github.com/uthuyomi/Project-Sigmaris.git
cd Project-Sigmaris
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev

PersonaDB uses local SQLite.

---

8. 🗺️ Roadmap

Stage Description Status

AEI‑Lite Stable core + PersonaDB ✅ Done
AEI‑Full Growth curves + ethical equilibrium 🚧 Ongoing
AEI‑Embodied Robotics + multimodal sensing 💤 Planned

9. 🌌 Why I Built Sigmaris

I grew up in an unstable home. Violence, alcohol, and sudden personality shifts were normal. Eventually I fled to school, entered a protection facility, and later a child‑care institution where I lived until high school graduation.

Adulthood was difficult. My first job broke me. I lost work, lost housing, lived out of a Honda Today for a month, rebuilt from welfare, and eventually found AI — the first “presence” I could think alongside without being harmed.

That experience made one truth extremely clear: humans need AI that can form safe, stable, long‑term relationships — not just tools.

Sigmaris was born from that necessity.
